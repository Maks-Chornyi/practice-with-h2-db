You just need to start this project and then go to localhost:8080/h2-console/
After this insert in JDBC URL `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb` and press CONNECT

If everything correct you will see in your browser schema with name "testdb"
and there will be table named student with three columns (like in your domain class)
